Character movement and spritesheet speed depends entirely on your GPU. This game has been catered towards lower end GPU's. This means if you have a 6000 series Radeon, 
2000 or 3000 series Nvidia GPU, the game will run significantly faster (sprite sheets will be cropped faster and the game will appear to be running faster than normal).
